0) (1pt) Edit insert.mongo, and make a mongo script to add the file
   CoffeePeople.json to a collection called coffee, and add the file
   CoffeeShops.json to the same collection.
   - You can do this in mongo shell using the cat() function to read a file as 
     a string, then use .split() method to split the string into an array of
     lines, then for each line, use JSON.parse() to parse it into a JavaScript
     value and insert it into the collection.
