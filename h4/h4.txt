CS457/557 Spring 2019 HW #4

Using the following schema (and provided coffee.sql file):
    Drinks(name,coffee)
    People(name,age,gender)
    Serves(shop,coffee,price)
    Visits(name,shop)

Put your solutions in the SQLite script named h4.sql. Number the problems using
comments. In SQL anything following two dashes ('--') on a line is a comment.

 1) (1pt) Display a listing of all shops with the minimum, maximum and average
    age (rounded to 2 decimal places) (shop, min, max, average) of their
    visitors and order the output by increasing average age.

 2) (1pt) Produce a top 10 ranking (from most favored to least) of coffees
    favored by women.

 3) (2pts) Insert a new person (you!) into your data base and add yourself to
    the list that likes 'kona' and 'bombon', and that visits 'the little cafe',
    'the busy bean', and 'the hideout'.

 4) (1pt) Raise the price of all coffees by ten percent (UPDATE).

 5) (1pt) Delete all 18 year olds from the list of people (in all tables).

 6) (1pt) Delete 'decaffeinated' from the list of coffees (again, all tables).

 7) (1pt) Create a view that shows all the available drinks and a count of the
    number of people that drink it.  The view should have two columns, coffee
    and count.

 8) (2pts) Create a new table with each person listed once. Show the name and
    age of the person, the most expensive coffee they drink that is served at a
    place they visit. So the new table has five columns: name, age, coffee,
    shop, price.
